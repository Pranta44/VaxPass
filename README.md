## Overview
### Description
VaxPass is a virtual vaccination card specifically designed to display vaccination cards for COVID-19. In future updates, other vaccinations may be included. Users will be able to do the following: 
- Login to app
- Register if new user 
- Access profile page and vaccination records 
- Upload vaccination record details 
- Upload image of vaccination card 
- Verify vaccination status 
- Access COVID-19 facts and resources 

## Product Spec
This project was primarily built in Android Studio and completely implemented with Java code. I also used Back4App to create and manage the database of users. 
All source code is public on GitHub via this link: https://github.com/TeannaP18/VaxPass

## Installation
The app is not currently ready for production and is not uploaded for public use on any application stores. To run the app you must have Android Studio installed with SDK Tools. To run the application simply download the source code,
open Android Studio and select open project. Navigate to the folder in which you've saved the source code and select the "build.gradle" file. Select "OK" button and the window should open up. Allow time for th project to build and 
configure the virtual device within the AVD manager. For this project I used the "Pixel 3 API 29" device. After everything builds you should be able to run the application and the emulator will show up with the login screen to start 
the app.
